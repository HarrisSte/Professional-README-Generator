# Professional README Generator

## Description
This application helps users create a professional README.md file using the command line. They are able to enter in information based on prompts displayed on the command line. When a user is prompted for a license, they will be able to have a choice of MIT, Apache, GPL, or None. Depending on the license chosen, the README preview will display a badge that is linked to additional information about that license. Once the user has answered all of the questions, the terminal will display a congratulatory message and a README file will be generated.
