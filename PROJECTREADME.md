# WEATHER DASHBOARD

# Description
This application helps users create a professional README.md file using the command line. They are able to enter in information based on prompts displayed on the command line. When a user is prompted for a license, they will be able to have a choice of MIT, Apache, GPL, or None. Depending on the license chosen, the README preview will display a badge that is linked to additional information about that license. Once the user has answered all of the questions, the terminal will display a congratulatory message and a README file will be generated.

There were many sources that I pulled from while working on this project. Some of which were my instructor, TAs, and classmates. I also visited office hours and made sure to read through the questions of my colleagues. Outside sources were sites such as W3Schools, MDN, Medium, and StackOverflow; both videos and articles. I also read through the materials for the week sent out by Lisa S, my student success coach.
